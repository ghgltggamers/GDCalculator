# GDCalculator
GDCalculator is a simple yet usefull application written by ghgltggamer and developed in Godot Open Source Game Engine 3. The main moive behind this project was to promote the OpenSource Community and Help the Developers to add an advanced Calculator feature in there Projects. This is a fully Open Source Project.

This project uses Godot as is UI Manager and Build manager and uses Godot Engine 3 Highly powerfull tools and it's scripting language for making a working calculator app

This Project is an simple but professional grade Calculator because it is made for uses as a physical calculator, While running this application you will see that how capable this is and it will feel like a physical calculator is running.

# Custom Projects
By using MIT License i have allowed everyone to use the source code and modify that for there needs but using the source code for illegal works is not allowed at any cost!
If not using for illegal or banned things then the source code is fully freely available for usage, modification or even create custom projects and builds.

# Privacy
This project is heavily focused on security which is why it does not collects any kind of user data , Because it's a privacy focused project. But also as a calulator it doesnot comes with firewall protections means yep it will not collect even a single word from your computer but this will also not be able to protect your pc from attackers. You need a trusted firewall for that.

# For Developers
If you are a developer uses godot engine or learning or even planning towards learning godot engine then feel free to use any source code from this project in your project! Happy coding.

# Directory explanation
this project has 4 directories:

## graphics <dir>
This directory contains the fonts , images and naterial files simplay because these are used as graphics assets so these are carefully stored in graphics directory. 

## icons <dir>
This is contains simply the icon files for final build mainly contains the icons for different Operating Systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux and 1k png properly with 1024x1024 . Main icon file is app_icon.png with 1080x1080 dimentions.

## Programs <dir>
This directory contains all the scripts used to develop this project and those script files are gdscript files only use are extremly critical because they are responsible for core functionality of the main project. Only modify these scripts if you know abotu how to program in gdscript othervise you can simply turn the app to become unresponsive.

## scenes
This directory is also important as this contains the main UI files or basically 2d or 3d scenes of Godot Engine for rendering the application with good quality widgets.

# File Explanation
A simple explanation for files

## <filename>.import <file>
These are the classic file extensions for the Godot Game Engine for importing the files and making them vissible in file system simply like KYC for a bank account (I know i gave a worst example but i tried my best to explain). Simply by .import files godot knows about imported files and how can be they used. Without these you won't be able to see the files on filesystem of godot

## default_env.tres
This is a Godot Specific file which i don't know soo much about but basicaly this file is the environment file for the Godot Engine Scenes as they needs an environment to be rendered perfectly.

## project.godot
This file is simply a meta file for godot game engine which tells the engine about the project just like json or xml but in a totaly different syntax and a different way. Simply these files contains information about the project like : name, description , godot version , editor version etc.

## app_icon.png
This is the application icon file which sets the default application icon for godot engine and exportings.

## LICENSE
This file is simply the license file which contains the MIT License with it.

---------------------------------------I hope this was a decent Readme file which can tell most of the things about project----------------------------
